# Decentralised Finance (DeFi)  

## Summary  
DeFi recreates traditional financial services using smart contracts, removing the need for intermediaries.  

## Key Points  

### Lending & borrowing  
Protocols like Aave and Compound allow users to lend assets and earn interest or borrow by posting collateral.  

### Decentralised exchanges  
Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap allow peer-to-peer trading without order books, relying on liquidity pools.  

### Liquidity pools & yield farming  
Users provide tokens to pools, earning trading fees or governance tokens.  
Yield farming involves optimising returns across protocols.  

### Staking  
Users lock tokens to secure a network or earn passive income.  
Ethereum PoS requires staking ETH to become a validator.  

### Risks  
- **Impermanent loss**: Losses compared to holding assets due to price volatility.   
- **Smart contract bugs**: Exploits can drain funds.  
- **Regulatory risks**: Unclear legal status.
