# Introduction to Blockchain

## Summary
Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks.

## Key Points
**What is a blockchain?**  
A blockchain is a digital ledger made up of blocks of data linked in chronological order.  
Each block contains transactions, a timestamp and a crpytographic hash of the previous block.
The structure of a blockchain makes it impossible to alter past data without having to change the entire chain.

**Key features:**  
**Decntralisation** - No single authority controls the system. It runs across a network of nodes  
**Transparency** - Transactions are visible on a public ledger which helps to ensure accountability of its users  
**Immutability** - Once blocks have been added, they cannot be changed. This prevents fraud and tampering  

**Types:**  
**Public** - Open to anyone  
**Private** - Controlled by one organisation - often used in enterprise settings  
**Consortium** - Semi-decentralised. Can be controlled by a group of organisations  

**Real-world use cases:**  
**Finance** - Cryptocurrencies, cross border payments, stablecoins  
**Supply chain** - Tracking goods from the origin to the consumer helping to improve trust  
**Identity** - Decentralised IDs where the users own their credentials  
**Gaming and NFTs** - Digital assets, collectbles and player-owned economies
