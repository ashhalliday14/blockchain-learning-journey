# DAOs & Governance  

## Summary  
DAOs are decentralised organisations governed by code and community votes instead of central authority.  

## Key Points  

### What is a DAO?  
A DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) operates through smart contracts, enabling transparent and collective decision-making.  

### Governance tokens  
Members hold tokens that represent voting power.  
The more tokens, the greater the influence (though some DAOs experiment with quadratic voting).  

### Voting mechanisms  
- Token-weighted voting.  
- Delegated voting.  
- Off-chain proposals with on-chain execution.  

### Examples  
- **MakerDAO**: Stablecoin governance for DAI.  
- **ENS DAO**: Manages the Ethereum Name Service.  
- **ConstitutionDAO**: Raised funds to bid on a copy of the US Constitution.
