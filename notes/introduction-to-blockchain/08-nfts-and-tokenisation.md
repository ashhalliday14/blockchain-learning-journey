# NFTs & Tokenisation  

## Summary  
NFTs represent unique digital assets, while tokenisation extends blockchain ownership to real-world items.  

## Key Points  

### NFTs explained  
NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are digital assets representing uniqueness and scarcity.  
Each NFT has metadata pointing to content (image, video, file).  

### Standards  
- **ERC-721**: Single-asset NFTs.  
- **ERC-1155**: Multi-asset standard, efficient for gaming and collections.  

### NFT marketplaces  
OpenSea, Rarible, and Blur allow users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs.  
Smart contracts manage ownership transfers.  

### Beyond art  
NFTs are used for in-game items, virtual land, domain names (ENS), music royalties, and real-world asset tokenisation.
