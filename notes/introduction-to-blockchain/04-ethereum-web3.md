# Ethereum & Web3 Fundamentals  

## Summary  
Ethereum introduced smart contracts and paved the way for Web3, a decentralised, user-owned internet.  

## Key Points  

### Ethereum vs Bitcoin  
Bitcoin is primarily digital money with a limited scripting language.  
Ethereum extended blockchain to support general-purpose programming via smart contracts, making it a decentralised world computer.  

### Accounts  
- **EOA (Externally Owned Account)**: Controlled by private keys, used by individuals.  
- **Contract Account**: Controlled by code (smart contracts).  

### Gas & transactions  
Gas measures computational work.  
Every transaction consumes gas, and users pay gas fees in ETH.  
Gas prevents spam and allocates resources efficiently.  

### What is Web3?  
Web3 refers to a decentralised internet where users own their data, identities, and digital assets.  
Instead of central platforms, interactions happen directly on blockchains using tokens and smart contracts.  

### Layer 1 vs Layer 2  
- **Layer 1**: Ethereum mainnet, the base blockchain.  
- **Layer 2**: Scaling solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum, zk-rollups) process transactions off-chain while inheriting Ethereumâ€™s security.
