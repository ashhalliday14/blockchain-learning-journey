# Decentralised Applications (dApps)  

## Summary  
dApps are applications that run on blockchain networks, combining smart contracts with user interfaces.  

## Key Points  

### Architecture  
A typical dApp consists of:  
- **Smart contracts**: Backend logic on the blockchain.  
- **Frontend**: Web or mobile UI.  
- **Blockchain node/API**: Provides access to blockchain data.  

### Web3 libraries  
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library for Ethereum.  
- **Ethers.js**: Lightweight alternative with strong developer adoption.  

### Wallet integration  
Wallets like Metamask allow users to connect to dApps.  
Wallets handle private keys and provide signing for transactions.  

### Deploying dApps  
Developers usually deploy smart contracts to testnets (Goerli, Sepolia) before mainnet.  
Tools like Hardhat and Truffle simplify deployment and testing.
